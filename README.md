To execute this cpp file in codeblocks make sure to do the following: <br />
- 1. Click on Settings -> Compiler Settings. <br />
- 2. Then make sure that the C++11 ISO checkbox is checked under Compiler Flags  <br />
Otherwise, You will get an error: " 'stoll' is not declared in the scope"  <br />

*NOTE*
- There is a hidden option (Option 10) to import contacts from a CSV file <br />
- The name of the CSV file must be "contact.csv" and it must be in the same folder  
- I've separated the encryptor function - https://gist.github.com/vigneshganesan008/2de8156a5d6c9560c496969c55863042
