To execute this cpp file in codeblocks make sure to do the following: <br />
- 1.Click on Settings -> Compiler Settings. <br />
- 2.Then make sure that the C++11 ISO checkbox is checked under Compiler Flags  <br />
Otherwise, You will get an error : " 'stoll' is not declared in the scope"  <br />

*NOTE*
- There is an hidden option (Option 10) to import contacts from a csv file <br />
- Name of CSV file must be named "contact.csv" and it must in the same folder  
- I have not added CUDA in this repo. (Exported into a seperate project. Will provide a link onces its complete)
